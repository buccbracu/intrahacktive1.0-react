          <strong>Objective:</strong> The CPC segment of IntraHacktive 1.0 aims
          to test participants&apos algorithmic and coding skills through
          competitive programming challenges.
        </li>
        <li className="mb-4">
          <strong>Format:</strong> The CPC will consist of multiple rounds,
          including online selection rounds and on-site finals.
        </li>
        <li className="mb-4">
          <strong>Platform:</strong> The contest will be conducted on a
          designated online coding platform and will be announced soon.
        </li>
        <li className="mb-4">
          <strong>Languages:</strong> Participants can code in any programming
          language supported by the coding platform.
        </li>
        <li className="mb-4">
          <strong>Teams:</strong> Participants have to form a team with 3
          members.
        </li>
        <li className="mb-4">
          <strong>Challenge:</strong> Participants will be presented with a
          series of algorithmic and data structure problems of varying
          difficulty levels.
        </li>
        <li className="mb-4">
          <strong>Scoring:</strong> Participants will earn points based on the
          correctness and efficiency of their solutions, following the ACM style
          of scoring. In this scoring system, both time and correctness play a
          crucial role, and penalties are applied for incorrect submissions and
          late submissions.
        </li>
        <li className="mb-4">
          <strong>Ranking:</strong> Participants will be ranked based on their
          total score. In case of a tie, the participant with a shorter
          submission time will be ranked higher.
        </li>
        <li className="mb-4">
          <strong>Finals:</strong> Top-performing participants from the
          selection rounds will advance to the on-site finals, where they will
          compete in a live coding environment.
        </li>
        <li className="mb-4">
          <strong>Prizes:</strong> Prizes will be awarded to the top 3 winners
          of the CPC based on their performance in the finals.
        </li>
        <li className="mb-4">
          <strong>Code of Conduct:</strong> Participants are expected to adhere
          to the coding platform&aposs code of conduct and guidelines. Any form
          of cheating, plagiarism, or unethical behavior will result in
          immediate disqualification.
