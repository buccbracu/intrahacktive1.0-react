                Online Submission Round:
              </strong>{" "}
              Teams will compete in an online proctored Database challenge,
              which will test the participants&apos; foundational database
              skills. Both members of the team must take the test individually,
              and their combined scores will be counted as the team&apos;s total
              score. Based on their performance, the top teams will qualify for

          online round will be proctored to ensure fairness and integrity.
          Participants must follow the proctoring guidelines provided during the
          competition. Participants must take the exam using a laptop or{" "}
          <b className="primary-color">PC equipped with a webcam</b>. The exam
          will be auto-proctored, so participants needs to ensure that their
          setup is ready before the exam starts.
          <br /> During the test,{" "}

            switching tabs is strictly prohibited

          requires designing a relational database schema. Teams can choose to
          write their solution as a detailed explanation or create diagrams to
          portray their database design. There will be no coding involved in
          this segment, and no direct questions will be asked. There will be
          scenario based hint questions to guide the participants in the right
          direction.
