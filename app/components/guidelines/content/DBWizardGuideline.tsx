          <strong>Objective:</strong> The Database Design Competition segment of
          IntraHacktive 1.0 aims to assess participants&apos; proficiency in
          designing efficient, normalized, and scalable database schemas.
        </li>
        <li className="mb-4">
          <strong>Format:</strong> The competition will consist of two main
          rounds:
          <ul className="list-disc pl-8">
            <li className="mb-4">
              <strong>Online Submission Round:</strong> Teams will submit their
              database schema designs based on a provided problem statement.
            </li>
            <li className="mb-4">
              <strong>Onsite Final Round:</strong> Top teams from the submission
              round will advance to the final round, where they will be given a
              real-world problem to solve and present their database solution.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li className="mb-4">
          <strong>Teams:</strong> Participants must form teams of 2 members.
        </li>
        <li className="mb-4">
          <strong>Challenge:</strong> In the final round, participants will be
          given a real-world problem statement that requires designing a
          relational database schema. Teams can choose to write their solution
          as a detailed explanation or create diagrams to portray their database
          design.
        </li>
        <li className="mb-4">
          <strong>Evaluation:</strong> Submissions will be evaluated based on
          adherence to normalization principles, database efficiency,
          scalability, and data integrity. Solutions should also demonstrate
          clear relationships between entities and logical organization.
        </li>
        <li className="mb-4">
          <strong>Presentation:</strong> Finalists will present their database
          designs to a panel of judges during the on-site finals. They must
          explain their design choices and how their solution addresses the
          real-world problem presented to them.
        </li>
        <li className="mb-4">
          <strong>Scoring:</strong> Judges will score based on the clarity and
          coherence of the solution, the logical structure of the database, the
          solutionâ€™s scalability, and the effectiveness in solving the
          real-world problem.
        </li>
        <li className="mb-4">
          <strong>Fees:</strong> A registration fee of 200 BDT per team is
          required after the final selection round.
        </li>
        <li className="mb-4">
          <strong>Prizes:</strong> Prizes will be awarded to the top-performing
          teams based on their performance in the finals.
        </li>
        <li className="mb-4">
          <strong>Code of Conduct:</strong> Participants are expected to
          maintain professionalism and academic integrity throughout the
          competition. Any form of plagiarism or unethical behavior will result
