        <li className="mb-4">
          <strong>Objective:</strong> The Debugging Competition segment of
          IntraHacktive 1.0 aims to evaluate participants&apos; ability to
          identify and fix bugs in provided code snippets.
        </li>
        <li className="mb-4">
          <strong>Format:</strong> The competition will consist of two rounds:
          <ul className="list-disc pl-8">
            <li className="mb-4">
              <strong>Online Round:</strong> Participants will compete in an
              online debugging challenge. Based on their performance, top
              participants will qualify for the final round.
            </li>
            <li className="mb-4">
              <strong>Onsite Final Round:</strong> Finalists will compete in a
              live debugging challenge held on campus, where they will be given
              more complex code snippets to debug.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li className="mb-4">
          <strong>Languages:</strong> Participants can choose to debug code
          written in either Python or Java, providing flexibility to work in
          their preferred language.
        </li>
        <li className="mb-4">
          <strong>Challenge:</strong> Participants will be given code snippets
          containing bugs, and they must debug the code to produce the correct
          output within a specified time limit.
        </li>
        <li className="mb-4">
          <strong>Scoring:</strong> Participants will earn points based on the
          number of bugs they successfully identify and fix. Extra points may be
          awarded for more efficient solutions.
        </li>
        <li className="mb-4">
          <strong>Ranking:</strong> Participants will be ranked based on their
          total score. In case of a tie, the participant who completes the
          challenge in a shorter time will be ranked higher.
        </li>
        <li className="mb-4">
          <strong>Fees:</strong> A registration fee of 100 BDT is required after
          the final selection round. If selected participants fail to make the
          payment, others from the waiting list will be chosen to take their
          place.
        </li>
        <li className="mb-4">
          <strong>Finals:</strong> Top-performing participants from the online
          round will advance to the onsite finals, where they will compete in a
          live debugging challenge.
        </li>
        <li className="mb-4">
          <strong>Prizes:</strong> Prizes will be awarded to the top 3 winners
          of the Debugging Competition based on their performance in the finals.
        </li>
        <li className="mb-4">
          <strong>Code of Conduct:</strong> Participants are expected to
          maintain integrity and professionalism throughout the competition. Any
