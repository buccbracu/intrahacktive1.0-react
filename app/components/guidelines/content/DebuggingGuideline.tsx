          <strong>Objective:</strong> The Debugging Competition segment of
          IntraHacktive 1.0 aims to evaluate participants &apos ability to
          identify and fix bugs in provided code snippets.
        </li>
        <li className="mb-4">
          <strong>Format:</strong> The competition will consist of multiple
          rounds, including online selection rounds and on-site finals.

        <li className="mb-4">
          <strong>Challenge:</strong> Participants will be given code snippets
          containing bugs, and they must debug the code to produce the correct
          output.
        </li>
        <li className="mb-4">
          <strong>Scoring:</strong> Participants will earn points based on the
